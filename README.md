## Core Settings
- Configure Audio / Video > Audio / Video Conference Mode: Disabled
  - Even having this enabled and not using it will cause idle FPS to drop 30-50%. Use Discord for now.

## Character Sheets
- [Tidy5e Sheet](https://github.com/sdenec/tidy5e-sheet) - Has QoL changes and is overall neater.
- [Sky's Alt5e Sheet](https://github.com/Sky-Captain-13/foundry/tree/master/alt5e) - Alternate layout of the default sheet.
- [Obsidian](https://bitbucket.org/Fyorl/obsidian/src/master/) - Dark mode essentially with a lot of high level customization. Slightly dangerous as it does change how actor data is stored.
- [Favorite Item Tab](https://github.com/syl3r86/favtab) - Adds a favorite item tab QoL improvment for people who want to stick with default.
- [DnDBeyond 5e Sheet](https://github.com/jopeek/fvtt-dndbeyond-character-sheet) - A character sheet that mimics the design of DnDBeyond's layout. Has an issue with filtering.
